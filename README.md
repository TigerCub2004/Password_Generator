<pros>: I enjoyed this program. Despite its difficulties, it was fun to write the code, and I enjoyed testing the program after it was completed.

<cons>: I did have some difficulties in the beginning but, thanks to help from Mrs. West, my AP CS A teacher, the issues were resolved. As it turns out, I was not supposed to initialize boolean variables that determined the range of the while loop. It would be much easier to just type the conditions into the while loop. In addition, through some trial and error, I was able to fix the "addition" of chars to the password string variable.
